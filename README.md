## Project Information
***Background:***   
As energy transition is becoming a trend in the last years. This project will be done to assess and analyze the existing renewable energy data to understand the market and able to give insight in formulating strategic decision for the future development.

The objective of this project is to  Determining the best renewable energy source for future development by assessing the existing renewable energy data being used in 10 Countries inside the dataset in the range of year 2000 - 2023

***Tools***  
Python and Tableau.

## Project Output / Conclusion

An analysis have been conducted based on the existing renewable energy data that is being used in 10 Countries in the range of year 2000 - 2023.  

From the anaysis, it can be concluded:

1. There are **5 types of energy source**: Solar, Geothermal, Biomass, Wind, and Hydro

2. **All the energy types share the similar value in terms of the proportions of the total project**. Inside the dataset, Solar is ranked first in terms of total project with 20.44% overall proportions.

3. Having the most quantity of project/power plant does not necessariliy mean having the most installed capacity and generate more electricity.

4. Both **installed capacity and accumulation of electricity generation** by all energy source are **sharing the relatively similar value**

5. Within the dataset, the **most installed capacity is coming from geothermal source**. However, **Biomass produces most electricity generation**.

6. The **distribution (IQR range) for invesment value** in all the energy source is also showing similar trend, which is at around **2.5 Billion USD - 7.5 Billion USD.**

7. From the trend analysis, it is shown that the **capacity being installed every year from 2000 - 2023 is fluctuating without any specific turning point**. No event such as paris agreement and other political event cause an impact within the analyzed data in the dataset

8. **The cost for invesment per MW installation is varying for all energy source**, where geothermal is being the cheapest and wind is the most expensive

9. Initial ROI Projection is also performed and the value is varying depending the energy source type. **The highest ROI percentage is coming from geothermal source. On the other hand, wind is having the lowest ROI expectation**.

10. Inferential analysis to check if the investment of solar source from one country is different from the other is performed. It is proven that **no difference in capital investment is required to invest in different countries.**
